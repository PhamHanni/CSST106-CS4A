# Exploring the Role of Computer Vision and Image Processing in AI

## Overview
This project explores the critical role of **computer vision** and **image processing** in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It covers essential image processing techniques, case studies, and practical implementations that demonstrate how AI systems interpret and analyze visual data.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Understand the importance of image processing in AI.
- Explore various image processing techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and segmentation.
- Discuss real-world applications like **autonomous vehicles** that utilize these techniques.
- Implement a simple image processing model to demonstrate its use in AI.

## Contents
1. **Presentation**: A PowerPoint presentation that provides an introduction to computer vision and image processing techniques in AI.
2. **Video**: A video walkthrough of the presentation is available for preview.
3. **Colab Implementation**: A practical demonstration of image processing using Python on Google Colab.

## Image Processing Implementation
You can explore the implementation of image processing techniques, such as edge detection and segmentation, through this interactive Google Colab notebook:

In this notebook, you will find:
- **Edge Detection**: The Canny edge detection algorithm applied to a sample image to identify the boundaries and edges of objects within the image.
- **Image Segmentation**: Techniques to segment an image into different regions, making it easier to identify specific objects or areas of interest.
- **Filtering**: A demonstration of noise reduction using filters to enhance image quality and improve feature extraction.

### Explanation:
The Colab notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of basic image processing techniques. By running the code, you can experiment with applying filters, detecting edges, and segmenting images. These processes are critical in enabling AI systems to interpret visual data more effectively. The notebook includes both the code and explanations for how these techniques are implemented and how they contribute to solving real-world visual problems.

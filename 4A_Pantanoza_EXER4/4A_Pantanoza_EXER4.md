# Python Exercise 4 Documentation

This repository contains Exercise 4 of the Python course, which focuses on implementing and comparing various object detection models. This exercise demonstrates Python programming skills within computer vision tasks, using both traditional and deep learning methods.

## Overview

Exercise 4 covers the following major techniques:

1. **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Object Detection**:
   - Uses HOG descriptors for feature extraction to perform object detection, representing a traditional computer vision approach.

2. **YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection**:
   - Applies the YOLO model, known for its speed and efficiency, for real-time object detection.

3. **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) with TensorFlow**:
   - Uses the SSD model, a deep learning approach that combines speed with high accuracy, implemented in TensorFlow.

4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compares the results of the SSD and YOLO models, evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, and detection capabilities across different datasets.

5. **Traditional vs. Deep Learning Object Detection**:
   - Analyzes and contrasts traditional object detection (e.g., HOG) with deep learning-based methods (e.g., YOLO, SSD), discussing strengths, limitations, and practical applications.

## Structure

The notebook is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Preprocesses and prepares data for object detection models, ensuring compatibility with both traditional and deep learning methods.

2. **Model Implementations**:
   - HOG: Uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients for feature-based object detection.
   - YOLO: Employs the YOLO framework for efficient deep learning-based object detection.
   - SSD: Uses Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with TensorFlow for deep learning-based object detection.

3. **Results Comparison**:
   - Compares SSD and YOLO, evaluating metrics such as accuracy, speed, and model efficiency.

4. **Traditional vs. Deep Learning Analysis**:
   - A comparative study discussing the strengths and weaknesses of traditional object detection methods like HOG against deep learning models such as YOLO and SSD.

# Python Exercise 3 Documentation

This repository contains Exercise 3 of the Python course, showcasing key Python programming concepts and techniques. Below is a breakdown of the exercise and its major components.

## Overview

Exercise 3 explores various Python functionalities, demonstrating concepts such as data manipulation, function creation, and visualization. This exercise is designed to help users practice skills in:

- Data input and processing
- Function definitions and control structures
- Data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn (if applicable)

## Structure

The notebook consists of several main sections:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Data is loaded and preprocessed for analysis, with steps such as data cleaning and transformation.
   
2. **Function Definitions**:
   - Key functions are created to perform specific tasks, enabling modular and reusable code. Each function is documented to explain its purpose and inputs/outputs.
   
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Various analyses are performed, potentially including statistical calculations, pattern identification, or summary metrics.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Data is visualized using plots, providing insights into patterns or trends in the dataset.

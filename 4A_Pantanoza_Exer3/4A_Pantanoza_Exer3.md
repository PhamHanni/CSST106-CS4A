# Python Exercise 3 Documentation

This repository contains Exercise 3 of the Python course, focusing on implementing and exploring various feature extraction, keypoint detection, and image segmentation techniques in computer vision.

## Overview

Exercise 3 demonstrates practical applications of foundational computer vision techniques, including:

1. **Harris Corner Detection**: Detects corners in an image, a crucial feature for many computer vision tasks.
2. **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Feature Extraction**: Extracts gradient orientation histograms as features, useful for object recognition.
3. **FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) Keypoint Detection**: Quickly identifies keypoints in an image, enabling efficient feature matching.
4. **Feature Matching using ORB and FLANN**: Matches keypoints across images using the ORB detector and FLANN-based matcher for robust feature correspondence.
5. **Image Segmentation using Watershed Algorithm**: Segments an image into regions, facilitating object and background separation.

## Structure

The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Feature Detection and Extraction Techniques**:
   - **Exercise 1**: Applies Harris Corner Detection to identify corner features in an image.
   - **Exercise 2**: Implements HOG for feature extraction, capturing essential object details for later analysis.
   - **Exercise 3**: Uses FAST to detect keypoints efficiently, focusing on corners and edges.

2. **Feature Matching**:
   - **Exercise 4**: Uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) combined with FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) to match features between images, aiding in tasks like object recognition and tracking.

3. **Image Segmentation**:
   - **Exercise 5**: Applies the Watershed Algorithm to segment images, creating distinct regions to separate objects from the background.

## Techniques and Models Used

- **Harris Corner Detection**: Corner detection technique to find points of interest in an image.
- **HOG Feature Extraction**: Gradient-based feature extraction method for capturing object appearance and shape.
- **FAST Keypoint Detection**: Efficient keypoint detection for real-time applications.
- **ORB and FLANN for Feature Matching**: Combines ORB detector and FLANN matcher for reliable feature matching.
- **Watershed Algorithm**: Segmentation technique used to delineate image regions based on gradients.
